Sample application for spring-mvc with spring-security (really dummy, but two possible roles), spring-test, spring-jdbc and validation.

DataSource:
	By default in-memory HSQLDB datasource is used. It is managed with Spring profiles and if you want to test on PostgreSQL (tested on 8.4) you should run aplication with "postgres" spring profile. To do so you may run JVM with system property -Dspring.profiles.active="postgres". Where this should be done depends on you application server. On the start application will drop tables department/employee in DB if they exist, create them again and populate with test data.
Unit tets:
	In-memory HSQLDB datasource is used and spring-test is used for testing.
Logging:
	slf4j-simple is used through slf4j interfaces, which logs all info to System.out and should not be used in production.
Security:
	Two users are defined in the system - "editor/editor" and "viewer/viewer". Default spring-security options for form authentication, login/logout urls are used. Users are not stored in DB, password are not hashed, as it is expected from the real security system.
I18n: 
	Most messages are given in Russian and English - the "change language" links are next to the logout.
